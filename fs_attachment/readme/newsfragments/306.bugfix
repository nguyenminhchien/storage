When manipulating the file system api through a local variable named *fs*,
we observed some strange behavior when it was wrongly redefined in an
enclosing scope as in the following example: *with fs.open(...) as fs*.
This commit fixes this issue by renaming the local variable and therefore
avoiding the name clash.
