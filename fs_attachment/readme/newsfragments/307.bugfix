Before this change, when the fs_url was computed the computed value was always
reassigned to the fs_url attribute even if the value was the same. In a lot of
cases the value was the same and the reassignment was not necessary. Unfortunately
this reassignment has as side effect to mark the record as dirty and generate a
SQL update statement at the end of the transaction.
